--- WARNING ---

This is an ongoing project. It is still in an early development stage. IRC Clients can only connect and disconnect to the server, no other commands are implemented yet.

Dependencies:
libpthread
libev (libev4, libev-dev)
libssl, libcrypto (libssl-dev)

To compile:
make

To generate documentation:
make doc

To run:

./yaircd.out

After that, open up a few terminals and try:
telnet 127.0.0.1 6667

Or open up an IRC client and connect to the server. No commands other than NICK, USER and QUIT are implemented. NICK only works for registering the connection.
