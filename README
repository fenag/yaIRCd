--- WARNING ---

This is an ongoing project. It is still in an early development stage. IRC Clients can only:

- Connect to the server
- Disconnect from the server
- Join a channel
- Part a channel
- Talk to a channel
- Use private message
- Issue WHOIS commands

No other commands are implemented yet. There are no channel modes, no operators, nothing.
QUIT command is not fully implemented yet; quit events are not spread to other clients, which means that someone who quits will show up on the channel user's list forever, because the server doesn't notify
other channel clients about QUITS.

Dependencies:
libpthread
libev (libev4, libev-dev)
libssl, libcrypto (libssl-dev)
libconfig

To compile:
make

To generate documentation (requires Doxygen):
make doc

To configure, edit yaircd.conf

To run:

./yaircd.out

After that, open up a few terminals and try:
telnet 127.0.0.1 6667

Or open up an IRC client and connect to the server. No commands other than NICK, USER and QUIT are implemented. NICK only works for registering the connection.
