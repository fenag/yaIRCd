--- WARNING ---

This is an ongoing project. It is still in an early development stage. IRC Clients can only use the following commands:

* JOIN
* PART
* PRIVMSG, both to channels and to another user
* WHOIS (no idle time reports yet)
* LIST
* QUIT
* NICK and USER, but only for unregistered connections (NICK on registered connections is not supported yet, i.e., you can't change your nick after connecting, sorry!)

No other commands are implemented yet. There are no channel modes, no operators, nothing.

Dependencies:
libpthread
libev (libev4, libev-dev)
libssl, libcrypto (libssl-dev)
libconfig

To compile:
make

To generate documentation:
make doc

To configure, edit yaircd.conf

To run:

./yaircd.out

After that, open up a few terminals and try:
telnet 127.0.0.1 6667

Or use an IRC client.
