@brief Client's messages queue management functions
This file provides a module that knows how to operate on a client's messages queue.
It is easy for a client's thread to wake up and read incoming data using an IO watcher. However, sporadically, we also need to wake up a client's thread to write to his socket.
For example, if user A PRIVMSGs user B, user A's thread must be able to somehow inform user B thread that something needs to be sent to user B.
To do so, we use an async watcher. An async watcher allows an arbitrary thread X to wake up another thread Y. Thread Y must be running an events loop and must have initialized and started an async watcher.
An async watcher works pretty much the same way as an IO watcher, but libev's documentation explicitly states that queueing is not supported. In other words, if more async messages arrive when we are processingan async callback, these will be silently discarded. To avoid losing messages like this, we implement our own messages queueing system.
Each client holds a queue of messages waiting to be written to his socket. These messages can originate from any thread.
Every operation in a client's queue shall be invoked through the use of the functions declared in this file.
These functions are not thread-safe. It is assumed that they are called by a thread-safe module.

@param queue The queue to destroy.
@return `0` on success, `-1` if the destroy operation was not successfull. The error condition should never happen if this module is used properly and no race conditions occur. If `-1` is returned, it means something went terribly wrong with the thread synchronization mechanism used in a queue. For example, maybe a queue destroy operation was invoked whena lock to this queue was active.
@warning Queue destroy operations must be performed carefully to avoid race conditions. The code that uses this module must ensure that after a queue is destroyed, no other thread will try to insert new messages in this queue. The program shall consider the case that a thread successfully destroys a queue, and is immediately interrupted after that, switching to another thread that was stopped precisely in an enqueue operation. This situation cannot occur; the IRCd will fail miserably and crash if it happens.
