		cloak block
		
		This block defines the server's cloak keys. Cloaking keys are used as salt to compute a user's cloaked host.
		A cloaked host is a way to protect user's privacy by hiding their real IP or hostname behind a hash, but still allowing regular channel operators to ban whole IP ranges. 
		To calculate such a hash, and to better resist to brute force attacks and make it safe, a set of 3 different salt keys are used. These keys should be kept secret, and must be difficult to guess.
		We recommend choosing keys with lower and upper case letters, and some digits. These keys should be different and ideally randomly generated. Please choose keys with at least 5 alphanumeric characters,
		and at most 100 aplhanumeric characters.
		Another setting to choose is the net prefix. This is not related to security, it is just a little setting you can play with for fun. It's a prefix that will be attached to every cloaked hostname on a user.
		For example, if a user's cloaked host is "C4FEA00B.dsl.telepac.pt" and the next prefix is "xp", then the final result it "xp-C4FEA00B.dsl.telepac.pt".
		The net prefix is only prepended to IPs for which a reverse hostname lookup was successfull.
		
		THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT: It is imperative that the net prefix and the cloak keys are the same in every server belonging to an IRC network. Channel bans will not work properly if the keys are different.
