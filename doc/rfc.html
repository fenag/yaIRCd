<h1>1.  Introduction</h1>

   <p>The IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol has been designed over a
   number of years for use with text based conferencing.  This document
   describes the current IRC protocol.</p>

   <p>The IRC protocol has been developed on systems using the TCP/IP
   network protocol, although there is no requirement that this remain
   the only sphere in which it operates.</p>

   <p>IRC itself is a teleconferencing system, which (through the use of
   the client-server model) is well-suited to running on many machines
   in a distributed fashion.  A typical setup involves a single process
   (the server) forming a central point for clients (or other servers)
   to connect to, performing the required message delivery/multiplexing
   and other functions.</p>

<a name="c1_1"></a>
<h2>1.1 Servers</h2>

   <p>The server forms the backbone of IRC, providing a point to which
   clients may connect to to talk to each other, and a point for other
   servers to connect to, forming an IRC network.  The only network
   configuration allowed for IRC servers is that of a spanning tree [see
   Fig. 1] where each server acts as a central node for the rest of the
   net it sees.</p>

<h2>1.2 Clients</h2>

   <p>A client is anything connecting to a server that is not another
   server.  Each client is distinguished from other clients by a unique
   nickname having a maximum length of nine (9) characters.  See the
   protocol grammar rules for what may and may not be used in a
   nickname.  In addition to the nickname, all servers must have the
   following information about all clients: the real name of the host
   that the client is running on, the username of the client on that
   host, and the server to which the client is connected.</p>

   <p><i>
	15-441 Note: The real name of the client's host should be
	obtained via a reverse lookup of the client's IP address. If
	the reverse lookup fails, use the IP address as the real name.
   </i></p>

<a name="c1_2_1"></a>
<h3>1.2.1 Operators</h3>

   <p>To allow a reasonable amount of order to be kept within the IRC
   network, a special class of clients (operators) is allowed to perform
   general maintenance functions on the network.  Although the powers
   granted to an operator can be considered as 'dangerous', they are
   nonetheless required.  Operators should be able to perform basic
   network tasks such as disconnecting and reconnecting servers as
   needed to prevent long-term use of bad network routing.  In
   recognition of this need, the protocol discussed herein provides for
   operators only to be able to perform such functions.  See sections
   <a href="#c4_1_7">4.1.7</a> (SQUIT) and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Edga/15-441/S08/project1/rfc/chapter4.html#c4_3_5">4.3.5</a> (CONNECT).</p>

   <p>A more controversial power of operators is the ability  to  remove  a
   user  from  the connected network by 'force', i.e. operators are able
   to close the connection between any client and server.   The
   justification for  this  is delicate since its abuse is both
   destructive and annoying.  For further details on this type of
   action, see section <a href="#c4_6_1">4.6.1</a> (KILL).</p>

    <i>15-441 Note: We will not implement operator-related features
    for this project.</i>

<a name="c1_3"></a>
<h2>1.3 Channels</h2>

   <p>A channel is a named group of one or more clients which will all
   receive messages addressed to that channel.  The channel is created
   implicitly when the first client joins it, and the channel ceases to
   exist when the last client leaves it.  While channel exists, any
   client can reference the channel using the name of the channel.</p>

   <p>Channels names are strings (beginning with a '&amp;' or '#' character) of
   length up to 200 characters.  Apart from the the requirement that the
   first character being either '&amp;' or '#'; the only restriction on a
   channel name is that it may not contain any spaces (' '), a control G
   (^G or ASCII 7), or a comma (',' which is used as a list item
   separator by the protocol).</p>

    <i>15-441 Note: For this project, channels (like nicknames) can be at
    most 9 characters, including # and &amp;.</i>

   <p>There are two types of channels allowed by this protocol.  One is a
   distributed channel which is known to all the servers that are
   connected to the network. These channels are marked by the first
   character being a '#'. The other type is a local channel. For a local
   channel, only clients on the server where the channel exists may join
   the channel. These are distinguished by a leading '&amp;' character.  On top of
   these two types, there are the various channel modes available to
   alter the characteristics of individual channels.  See section <a href="#c4_2_3">4.2.3</a>
   (MODE command) for more details on this.</p>

   <p>To create a new channel or become part of an existing channel, a user
   is required to JOIN the channel.  If the channel doesn't exist prior
   to joining, the channel is created and the creating user becomes a
   channel operator.  If the channel already exists, whether or not your
   request to JOIN that channel is honoured depends on the current modes
   of the channel. For example, if the channel is invite-only, (+i),
   then you may only join if invited.  As part of the protocol, a user
   may be a part of several channels at once, but a limit of ten (10)
   channels is recommended as being ample for both experienced and
   novice users.  See section <a href="#c8_13">8.13</a> for more information on this.</p>

   <p>If the IRC network becomes disjoint because of a split between two
   servers, the channel on each side is only composed of those clients
   which are connected to servers on the respective sides of the split,
   possibly ceasing to exist on one side of the split.  When the split
   is healed, the connecting servers announce to each other who they
   think is in each channel and the mode of that channel.  If the
   channel exists on both sides, the JOINs and MODEs are interpreted in
   an inclusive manner so that both sides of the new connection will
   agree about which clients are in the channel and what modes the
   channel has.</p>

<a name="c1_3_1"></a>
<h3>1.3.1 Channel Operators</h3>

   <p>The channel operator (also referred to as a "chop" or "chanop") on a
   given channel is considered to 'own' that channel.  In recognition of
   this status, channel operators are endowed with certain powers which
   enable them to keep control and some sort of sanity in their channel.
   As an owner of a channel, a channel operator is not required to have
   reasons for their actions, although if their actions are generally
   antisocial or otherwise abusive, it might be reasonable to ask an IRC
   operator to intervene, or for the usersjust leave and go elsewhere
   and form their own channel.</p>

   <p>The commands which may only be used by channel operators are:</p>

        <dl compact="compact">
        <dt>KICK</dt>    <dd>- Eject a client from the channel</dd>
        <dt>MODE</dt>    <dd>- Change the channel's mode</dd>
        <dt>INVITE</dt>  <dd>- Invite a client to an invite-only channel (mode +i)</dd>
        <dt>TOPIC</dt>   <dd>- Change the channel topic in a mode +t channel</dd>
        </dl>

   <p>A channel operator is identified by the '@' symbol next to their
   nickname whenever it is associated with a channel (ie replies to the
   NAMES, WHO and WHOIS commands).</p>

<h1>2. The IRC Specification</h1>

<a name="c2_1"></a>
<h2>2.1 Overview</h2>

   <p>The protocol as described herein is for use both with server to
   server and client to server connections.  There are, however, more
   restrictions on client connections (which are considered to be
   untrustworthy) than on server connections.</p>

<a name="c2_2"></a>
<h2>2.2 Character codes</h2>

   <p>No specific character set is specified. The protocol is based on a a
   set of codes which are composed of eight (8) bits, making up an
   octet.  Each message may be composed of any number of these octets;
   however, some octet values are used for control codes which act as
   message delimiters.</p>

   <p>Regardless of being an 8-bit protocol, the delimiters and keywords
   are such that protocol is mostly usable from USASCII terminal and a
   telnet connection.</p>

   <p>Because of IRC's scandanavian origin, the characters {}| are
   considered to be the lower case equivalents of the characters []\,
   respectively. This is a critical issue when determining the
   equivalence of two nicknames.</p>

<a name="c2_3"></a>
<h2>2.3 Messages</h2>

   <p>Servers and clients send eachother messages which may or may not
   generate a reply.  If the message contains a valid command, as
   described in later sections, the client should expect a reply as
   specified but it is not advised to wait forever for the reply; client
   to server and server to server communication is essentially
   asynchronous in nature.</p>

   <p>Each IRC message may consist of up to three main parts: the prefix
   (optional), the command, and the command parameters (of which there
   may be up to 15).  The prefix, command, and all parameters are
   separated by one (or more) ASCII space character(s) (0x20).</p>

   <p>The presence of a prefix is indicated with a single leading ASCII
   colon character (':', 0x3b), which must be the first character of the
   message itself.  There must be no gap (whitespace) between the colon
   and the prefix.  The prefix is used by servers to indicate the true
   origin of the message.  If the prefix is missing from the message, it
   is assumed to have originated from the connection from which it was
   received.  Clients should not use prefix when sending a message from
   themselves; if they use a prefix, the only valid prefix is the
   registered nickname associated with the client.  If the source
   identified by the prefix cannot be found from the server's internal
   database, or if the source is registered from a different link than
   from which the message arrived, the server must ignore the message
   silently.</p>

   <p>The command must either be a valid IRC command or a three (3) digit
   number represented in ASCII text.</p>

   <p>IRC messages are always lines of characters terminated with a CR-LF
   (Carriage Return - Line Feed) pair, and these messages shall not
   exceed 512 characters in length, counting all characters including
   the trailing CR-LF. Thus, there are 510 characters maximum allowed
   for the command and its parameters.  There is no provision for
   continuation message lines.  See <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Edga/15-441/S08/project1/rfc/chapter8.html#c8">Section
   8</a> for more details about current implementations.</p>

    <p><i>15-441 Note: Your server must handle message termination as
    specified in <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Edga/15-441/S08/project1/rfc/chapter8.html#c8">Section 8</a></i><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Edga/15-441/S08/project1/rfc/chapter8.html#c8">.</a></p><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Edga/15-441/S08/project1/rfc/chapter8.html#c8">
</a><a name="c2_3_1"></a>
<h3>2.3.1 Message format in 'pseudo' BNF</h3>

   <p>The protocol messages must be extracted from the contiguous stream of
   octets.  The current solution is to designate two characters, CR and
   LF, as message separators.   Empty  messages  are  silently  ignored,
   which permits  use  of  the  sequence  CR-LF  between  messages
   without extra problems.</p>

   <p>The extracted message is parsed into the components &lt;prefix&gt;,
   &lt;command&gt; and list of parameters matched either by &lt;middle&gt; or
   &lt;trailing&gt; components.</p>

   <p>The BNF representation for this is:</p>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lt;message&gt;  ::=</dt> <dd>[':' &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;SPACE&gt; ] &lt;command&gt; &lt;params&gt; &lt;crlf&gt;</dd>
<dt>&lt;prefix&gt;   ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;servername&gt; | &lt;nick&gt; | &lt;extended prefix&gt;</dd>
<dt>&lt;extended prefix&gt; ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;nick&gt;'!'&lt;user&gt;'@'&lt;host&gt;</dd>
<dt>&lt;command&gt;  ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;letter&gt; { &lt;letter&gt; } | &lt;number&gt; &lt;number&gt; &lt;number&gt;</dd>
<dt>&lt;SPACE&gt;    ::=</dt> <dd>' ' { ' ' }</dd>
<dt>&lt;params&gt;   ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;SPACE&gt; [ ':' &lt;trailing&gt; | &lt;middle&gt; &lt;params&gt; ]</dd>

<dt>&lt;middle&gt;   ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;Any *non-empty* sequence of octets not including SPACE or NUL or CR or LF, the first of which may not be ':'&gt;</dd>
<dt>&lt;trailing&gt; ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;Any, possibly *empty*, sequence of octets not including  NUL or CR or LF&gt;</dd>

<dt>&lt;crlf&gt;     ::=</dt> <dd>CR LF</dd>
</dl>

<p>NOTES:</p>

  <ol start="1" compact="compact" type="1">
  <li>  &lt;SPACE&gt; is consists only of SPACE character(s) (0x20).
        Specially notice that TABULATION, and all other control
        characters are considered NON-WHITE-SPACE.</li>

  <li>  After extracting the parameter list, all parameters are equal,
        whether matched by &lt;middle&gt; or &lt;trailing&gt;. &lt;Trailing&gt; is just
        a syntactic trick to allow SPACE within parameter.</li>

  <li>  The fact that CR and LF cannot appear in parameter strings is
        just artifact of the message framing. This might change later.</li>

  <li>  The NUL character is not special in message framing, and
        basically could end up inside a parameter, but as it would
        cause extra complexities in normal C string handling. Therefore
        NUL is not allowed within messages.</li>

  <li>  The last parameter may be an empty string.</li>

  <li>  The extended prefix (['!' &lt;user&gt; ] ['@' &lt;host&gt; ]) must
        not be used in server to server communications. However, it
        must be used for server to client messages.</li>
  </ol>

   <p>Most protocol messages specify additional semantics and syntax for
   the extracted parameter strings dictated by their position in the
   list.  For example, many server commands will assume that the first
   parameter after the command is the list of targets, which can be
   described with:</p>

   <dl compact="compact">
   <dt>&lt;target&gt;     ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;to&gt; [ "," &lt;target&gt; ]</dd>
   <dt>&lt;to&gt;         ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;channel&gt; | &lt;user&gt; '@' &lt;servername&gt; | &lt;nick&gt; | &lt;mask&gt;</dd>
   <dt>&lt;channel&gt;    ::=</dt> <dd>('#' | '&amp;') &lt;chstring&gt;</dd>
   <dt>&lt;servername&gt; ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;host&gt;</dd>
   <dt>&lt;host&gt;       ::=</dt> <dd>see RFC 952 [DNS:4] for details on allowed hostnames</dd>
   <dt>&lt;nick&gt;       ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;letter&gt; { &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;number&gt; | &lt;special&gt; }</dd>
   <dt>&lt;mask&gt;       ::=</dt> <dd>('#' | '$') &lt;chstring&gt;</dd>
   <dt>&lt;chstring&gt;   ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;any 8bit code except SPACE, BELL, NUL, CR, LF and comma (',')&gt;</dd>
   </dl>

   <p>Other parameter syntaxes are:</p>

   <dl compact="compact">
   <dt>&lt;user&gt;       ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;nonwhite&gt; { &lt;nonwhite&gt; }</dd>
   <dt>&lt;letter&gt;     ::=</dt> <dd>'a' ... 'z' | 'A' ... 'Z'</dd>
   <dt>&lt;number&gt;     ::=</dt> <dd>'0' ... '9'</dd>
   <dt>&lt;special&gt;    ::=</dt> <dd>'-' | '[' | ']' | '\' | '`' | '^' | '{' | '}'</dd>
   <dt>&lt;nonwhite&gt;   ::=</dt> <dd>&lt;any 8bit code except SPACE (0x20), NUL (0x0), CR (0xd), and LF (0xa)&gt;</dd>
   </dl>

<p><i>
15-441 Note: All targets will be nicks and channels. Masks and
user@servername will not be used in the project.
</i></p>

<a name="c2_4"></a>
<h2>2.4 Numeric replies</h2>

   <p>Most of the messages sent to the server generate a reply of some
   sort.  The most common reply is the numeric reply, used for both
   errors and normal replies.  The numeric reply must be sent as one
   message consisting of the sender prefix, the three digit numeric,
   and the target of the reply.  In all other respects, a numeric
   reply is just like a normal message, except that the keyword is
   made up of 3 numeric digits rather than a string of letters.  A
   list of different replies is supplied in <a href="#c6">section 6</a>.</p>

   <p>Example:</p>

    <pre>    :irc-server.example.edu 421 nickname BOGUSCOMMAND :Unknown command
    </pre>

    <p><i>15-441 Note: For the sender prefix on messages originated by
    the server, you should use the hostname of the server, as returned
    by <code>gethostname()</code>. </i></p>

<h1>3. IRC Concepts.</h1>

                    [ Fig. 2. Sample small IRC network ]
</pre>

<a name="c3_1"></a>
<h2>3.1 One-to-one communication</h2>

   <p>Communication on a one-to-one basis is usually only performed by
   clients, since most server-server traffic is not a result of servers
   talking only to each other.  To provide a secure means for clients to
   talk to each other, it is required that all servers be able to send a
   message in exactly one direction along the spanning tree in order to
   reach any client.  The path of a message being delivered is the
   shortest path between any two points on the spanning tree.</p>

   <p>The following examples all refer to <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> above.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Example 1:</dt>
     <dd>A message between clients 1 and 2 is only seen by server A, which
     sends it straight to client 2.</dd>

<dt>Example 2:</dt>
     <dd>A message between clients 1 and 3 is seen by servers A &amp; B, and
     client 3.  No other clients or servers are allowed see the message.</dd>

<dt>Example 3:</dt>
     <dd>A message between clients 2 and 4 is seen by servers A, B, C &amp; D
     and client 4 only.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="c3_2"></a>
<h2>3.2 One-to-many</h2>

   <dd>The main goal of IRC is to provide a  forum  which  allows  easy  and
   efficient  conferencing (one to many conversations).  IRC offers
   several means to achieve this, each serving its own purpose.</dd>

<a name="c3_2_1"></a>
<h3>3.2.1 To a list</h3>

   <p>The least efficient style of one-to-many conversation is through
   clients talking to a 'list' of users.  How this is done is almost
   self explanatory: the client gives a list of destinations to which
   the message is to be delivered and the server breaks it up and
   dispatches a separate copy of the message to each given destination.
   This isn't as efficient as using a group since the destination list
   is broken up and the dispatch sent without checking to make sure
   duplicates aren't sent down each path.</p>

<a name="c3_2_2"></a>
<h3>3.2.2 To a group (channel)</h3>

   <p>In IRC the channel has a role equivalent to that of the multicast
   group; their existence is dynamic (coming and going as people join
   and leave channels) and the actual conversation carried out on a
   channel is only sent to servers which are supporting users on a given
   channel.  If there are multiple users on a server in the same
   channel, the message text is sent only once to that server and then
   sent to each client on the channel.  This action is then repeated for
   each client-server combination until the original message has fanned
   out and reached each member of the channel.

   </p><p>The following examples all refer to <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Example 4:</dt>
     <dt>Any channel with 1 client in it. Messages to the channel go to the
     server and then nowhere else.</dt>

<dt>Example 5:</dt>
     <dt>2 clients in a channel. All messages traverse a path as if they
     were private messages between the two clients outside a channel.</dt>

<dt>Example 6:</dt>
     <dt>Clients 1, 2 and 3 in a channel.  All messages to the channel are
     sent to all clients and only those servers which must be traversed
     by the message if it were a private message to a single client.  If
     client 1 sends a message, it goes back to client 2 and then via
     server B to client 3.</dt>

<h3>3.2.3 To a host/server mask</h3>

   <p>To provide IRC operators with some mechanism to send  messages  to  a
   large body of related users, host and server mask messages are
   provided.  These messages are sent to users whose host or server
   information  match that  of  the mask.  The messages are only sent to
   locations where users are, in a fashion similar to that of channels.</p>

   <i>15-441 Note: We will not implement masks for this project.</i>

<a name="c3_3"></a>
<h2>3.3 One-to-all</h2>

   <p>The one-to-all type of message is better described as a broadcast
   message, sent to all clients or servers or both.  On a large network
   of users and servers, a single message can result in a lot of traffic
   being sent over the network in an effort to reach all of the desired
   destinations.</p>

   <p>For some messages, there is no option but to broadcast it to all
   servers so that the state information held by each server is
   reasonably consistent between servers.</p>

<a name="c3_3_1"></a>
<h3>3.3.1 Client-to-Client</h3>

   <p>There is no class of message which, from a single message, results in
   a message being sent to every other client.</p>

<a name="c3_3_2"></a>
<h3>3.3.2 Client-to-Server</h3>

   <p>Most of the commands which result in a change of state information
   (such as channel membership, channel mode, user status, etc) must be
   sent to all servers by default, and this distribution may not be
   changed by the client.</p>

<a name="c3_3_3"></a>
<h3>3.3.3 Server-to-Server.</h3>

   <p>While most messages between servers are distributed to all 'other'
   servers, this is only required for any message that affects either a
   user, channel or server.  Since these are the basic items found in
   IRC, nearly all messages originating from a server are broadcast to
   all other connected servers.</p>

<h1>4. Message details</h1>

<p>On the following pages are descriptions of each message recognized by
the IRC server and client.  All commands described in this section
must be implemented by any server for this protocol.</p>

<p>Where the reply ERR_NOSUCHSERVER is listed, it means that the
&lt;server&gt; parameter could not be found.  The server must not send any
other replies after this for that command.</p>

<p>The server to which a client is connected is required to parse the
complete message, returning any appropriate errors.  If the server
encounters a fatal error while parsing a message, an error must be
sent back to the client and the parsing terminated.  A fatal error
may be considered to be incorrect command, a destination which is
otherwise unknown to the server (server, nick or channel names fit
this category), not enough parameters or incorrect privileges.</p>

<p>If a full set of parameters is presented, then each must be checked
for validity and appropriate responses sent back to the client.  In
the case of messages which use parameter lists using the comma as an
item separator, a reply must be sent for each item.</p>

<p>In the examples below, some messages appear using the full format:</p>

<p><tt>:Name COMMAND parameter list</tt></p>

<p>Such examples represent a message from "Name" in transit between
servers, where it is essential to include the name of the original
sender of the message so remote servers may send back a reply along
the correct path.</p>

<p>Note that while COMMAND is always given in uppercase in this
document, it may be in any case in protocol messages. Thus servers and
clients must implement case-insensitive matching for command names.</p>

<a name="c4_1"></a>
<h2>4.1 Connection Registration</h2>

<p>The commands described here are used to register a connection with an
IRC server as either a user or a server as well as correctly
disconnect.</p>

<p>A "PASS" command is not required for either client or server
connection to be registered. But, if provided, it must precede the
SERVER message or the latter of the NICK/USER combination.  It is
strongly recommended that all server connections have a password in
order to give some level of security to the actual connections.  The
recommended order for a client to register is as follows:</p>
   
   <menu>
   <ol start="1" compact="compact" type="1">
   <li>Pass message</li>
   <li>Nick message</li>
   <li>User message</li>
   </ol>
   </menu>

<p>Note, however, that the NICK and USER commands may be issued  in
either order.</p>

<p>After a client has completed the connection registration process, the
server will send a greeting, as detailed in <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Edga/15-441/S08/project1/rfc/chapter8.html#c8_5">Section 8.5</a>. </p>

<p>Until the connection is registered, the server must respond to any
non-registration commands with ERR_NOTREGISTERED. If the client has
not yet provided a nickname, '*' should be used in place of the
nickname in the error message.</p>

<p><i>15-441 Note: Instead of the elaborate greeting specified in Section
8.5, you should send a "message of the day", using the RPL_MOTDSTART,
RPL_MOTD, and RPL_ENDOFMOTD messages. You may choose whatever you
desire as the text of the message.</i></p>

<h3>4.1.1 Password message</h3>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command:</th><td>PASS</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters:</th><td>&lt;password&gt;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The PASS command is used to set a 'connection password'. If a
connection password will be used, it must be set before any attempt to
register the connection is made.  Currently this requires that clients
send a PASS command before sending the NICK/USER combination and
servers send a PASS command before any SERVER command.  The password
supplied must match the one contained in the C/N lines (for servers)
or I lines (for clients).  It is possible to send multiple PASS
commands before registering but only the last one sent is used for
verification and it may not be changed once registered.</p>

<h3>4.1.2 Nick message</h3>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>NICK</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;nickname&gt; [ &lt;hopcount&gt; ]</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>NICK message is used to give user a nickname or change the previous
one.  The &lt;hopcount&gt; parameter is only used by servers to indicate
how far away a nick is from its home server.  A local connection has
a hopcount of 0.  If supplied by a client, it must be ignored.</p>

<p>If a NICK message arrives at a server which already knows about an
identical nickname for another client, a nickname collision occurs.
As a result of a nickname collision, all instances of the nickname
are removed from the server's database, and a KILL command is issued
to remove the nickname from all other server's database. If the NICK
message causing the collision was a nickname change, then the
original (old) nick must be removed as well.</p>

<p>If the server recieves, from a directly connected client, a NICK
identical to one learned from another server, the server may issue an
ERR_NICKCOLLISION to the local client, drop the NICK command, and not
generate any kills.</p>

<p>If the server receives, from a directly connected client, a NICK
indentical to the NICK of an existing local local user, the server may
issue an ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE to the local client, drop the NICK command,
and not generate any kills.</p>

<p>If the user is already registered, the server must inform other
users of the change in nickname. To do this, the server echoes the
user's command to all other users that are on any of the same channels
as him. The server must include a prefix in the echoed command to
identify the originator of the command.</p>

<p>If the command is successful, and the user is not already
registered, no response is generated by the server.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

        <tr><td>ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE    </td><td>ERR_NICKCOLLISION</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
        </center>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>NICK Wiz                                         ; Introducing new nick "Wiz".

NICK Kilroy                                      ; user changes nickname from WiZ to Kilroy
:WiZ!someone@host.example.edu NICK Kilroy        ; server notifies other users that WiZ changed his nickname to Kilroy.
</pre>

<i>15-441 Note: You should handle duplicate nicknames using
ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE as described above. Your server should not generate
KILL messages.</i>

<h3>4.1.3 User message</h3>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>USER</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;username&gt; &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;servername&gt; &lt;realname&gt;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The USER message is used at the beginning of connection to specify
the username, hostname, servername and realname of a new user.  It is
also used in communication between servers to indicate new user
arriving on IRC, since only after both USER and NICK have been
received from a client does a user become registered.</p>

<p>Between servers USER must to be prefixed with client's NICKname.
Note that hostname and servername are normally ignored by the IRC
server when the USER command comes from a directly connected client
(for security reasons), but they are used in server to server
communication.  This means that a NICK must always be sent to a
remote server when a new user is being introduced to the rest of the
network before the accompanying USER is sent.</p>

<p>It must be noted that realname parameter must be the last parameter,
because it may contain space characters and must be prefixed with a
colon (':') to make sure this is recognised as such.</p>

<p>Since it is easy for a client to lie about its username by relying
solely on the USER message, the use of an "Identity Server" is
recommended.  If the host which a user connects from has such a
server enabled the username is set to that as in the reply from the
"Identity Server".</p>

<p>If the command is successful, no reply is generated</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

                      belongs to
</pre>

<p><i>
15-441 Note: As noted above, you should ignore the hostname specified
by the client. You should obtain the hostname via reverse lookup, as
mentioned in <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Edga/15-441/S08/project1/rfc/chapter1.html#c1_2">Section 1.2</a>.

<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>SERVER</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;servername&gt; &lt;hopcount&gt; &lt;info&gt;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The server message is used to tell a server that the other end of a
new connection is a server. This message is also used to pass server
data over whole net.  When a new server is connected to net,
information about it be broadcast to the whole network.  &lt;hopcount&gt;
is used to give all servers some internal information on how far away
all servers are.  With a full server list, it would be possible to
construct a map of the entire server tree, but hostmasks prevent this
from being done.</p>

<p>The SERVER message must only be accepted from either (a) a connection
which is yet to be registered and is attempting to register as a
server, or (b) an existing connection to another server, in  which
case the SERVER message is introducing a new server behind that
server.</p>

<p>Most errors that occur with the receipt of a SERVER command result in
the connection being terminated by the destination host (target
SERVER).  Error replies are usually sent using the "ERROR" command
rather than the numeric since the ERROR command has several useful
properties which make it useful here.</p>

<p>If a SERVER message is parsed and attempts to introduce a server
which is already known to the receiving server, the connection from
which that message must be closed (following the correct procedures),
since a duplicate route to a server has formed and the acyclic nature
of the IRC tree broken.</p>

<p>OPER message is used by a normal user to obtain operator privileges.
The combination of &lt;user&gt; and &lt;password&gt; are required to gain
Operator privileges.</p>

<p>If the client sending the OPER command supplies the correct password
for the given user, the server then informs the rest of the network
of the new operator by issuing a "MODE +o" for the clients nickname.</p>

<p>The OPER message is client-server only.</p>

<h3>4.1.6 Quit</h3>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>QUIT</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>[&lt;Quit message&gt;]</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A client session is ended with a quit message.  The server must close
the connection to a client which sends a QUIT message. If a "Quit
Message" is given, this will be sent instead of the default message,
the nickname. The server must inform other users of the client's
departure by echoing the QUIT command to all users sharing channels
with the departing client, in the same manner as for a nickname change.</p>

<p>When netsplits (disconnecting of two servers) occur, the quit message
is composed of the names of two servers involved, separated by a
space.  The first name is that of the server which is still connected
and the second name is that of the server that has become
disconnected.</p>

<p>If, for some other reason, a client connection is closed without  the
client  issuing  a  QUIT  command  (e.g.  client  dies and EOF occurs
on socket), the server must still notify other users of the client's
departure. The servers is required to fill in the quit message with
some sort  of  message  reflecting the nature of the event which
caused the departure.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

        <cneter>None.

</pre>

<p><i>15-441 Note: As specified above, if a client session is ended, the
 server must notify other users of the client's departure (including a 
client connection ends abruptly) by sending a QUIT message with some 
explanation to all other users sharing the channel with the departing 
client.</i></p>

<h3>4.1.7 Server quit message</h3>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>SQUIT</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;server&gt; &lt;comment&gt;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The SQUIT message is needed to tell about quitting or dead servers.
If a server wishes to break the connection to another server it must
send a SQUIT message to the other server, using the the name of the
other server as the server parameter, which then closes its
connection to the quitting server.</p>

<p>This command is also available operators to help keep a network of
IRC servers connected in an orderly fashion.  Operators may also
issue an SQUIT message for a remote server connection.  In this case,
the SQUIT must be parsed by each server inbetween the operator and
the remote server, updating the view of the network held by each
server as explained below.</p>

<p>The &lt;comment&gt; should be supplied by all operators who execute a SQUIT
for a remote server (that is not connected to the server they are
currently on) so that other operators are aware for the reason of
this action.  The &lt;comment&gt; is also filled in by servers which may
place an error or similar message here.</p>

<p>Both of the servers which are on either side of the connection being
closed are required to to send out a SQUIT message (to all its other
server connections) for all other servers which are considered to be
behind that link.</p>

<p>Similarly, a QUIT message must be sent to the other connected servers
rest of the network on behalf of all clients behind that link.  In
addition to this, all channel members of a channel which lost a
member due to the split must be sent a QUIT message.</p>

<p>If a server connection is terminated prematurely (e.g. the server  on
the  other  end  of  the  link  died),  the  server  which  detects
this disconnection is required to inform the rest of  the  network
that  the connection  has  closed  and  fill  in  the comment field
with something appropriate.</p>

<h2>4.2 Channel operations</h2>

<p>This group of messages is concerned with manipulating channels, their
properties (channel modes), and their contents (typically clients).
In implementing these, a number of race conditions are inevitable
when clients at opposing ends of a network send commands which will
ultimately clash.  It is also required that servers keep a nickname
history to ensure that wherever a &lt;nick&gt; parameter is given, the
server check its history in case it has recently been changed.</p>

<h3>4.2.1 Join message</h3>

<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;channel&gt;{,&lt;channel&gt;} [&lt;key&gt;{,&lt;key&gt;}]</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The JOIN command is used by client to start listening a specific
channel. If the channel does not exist, it is created
automatically. If the user is already on the channel, the message is
silently ignored.</p>

<p>Whether or not a client is allowed to join a channel is
checked only by the server the client is connected to; all other
servers automatically add the user to the channel when it is received
from other servers.  The conditions which affect this are as
follows:</p>
        
   <menu>
   <ol start="1" compact="compact" type="1">
   <li>the user must be invited if the channel is invite-only;</li>
   <li>the user's nick/username/hostname must not match any active bans;</li>
   <li>the correct key (password) must be given if it is set.</li>
   </ol>
   </menu>

<p>These are discussed in more detail under the MODE command (see
section <a href="#c4.2.3">4.2.3</a> for more details).</p>

<p>A server may limit the maximum number of channels to which a user
can simultaneously subscribe. If the JOIN command would result in the
user exceeding such a limit, the server must return
ERR_TOOMANYCHANNELS.</p>

<p>Once a user has joined a channel, they receive notice about all
commands their server receives which affect the channel.  This
includes MODE, KICK, JOIN, PART, QUIT and of course PRIVMSG/NOTICE.  The
JOIN command needs to be broadcast to all servers so that each server
knows where to find the users who are on the channel.  This allows
optimal delivery of PRIVMSG/NOTICE messages to the channel.</p>

<p>If a JOIN is successful, the user is then sent the channel's topic,
if set (using RPL_TOPIC) and the list of users who are on the channel
(using RPL_NAMREPLY), which must include the user joining. The list of
users is terminated with RPL_ENDOFNAMES. The JOIN command is echoed to
all users on the channel, including the new user. This is repeated for
each channel in the JOIN message.</p>

<p><i>15-441 Note: Instead of supporting a client to join multiple
channels simultaneously, your server should restrict a client to be
the member of at most one channel. Joining a new channel should
implicitly causes the client to leave the current channel. In such
case, to be compliant with standard IRC clients, your server should
make up a QUIT message (assuming it from the leaving client) (see <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Edga/15-441/S08/project1/rfc/chapter4.html#c4_1_6">Section 4.1.6</a>) to echo

<p>The MODE command is a dual-purpose command in IRC.  It allows both
usernames and channels to have their mode changed.  The rationale for
this choice is that one day nicknames will be obsolete and the
equivalent property will be the channel.</p>

<p>When parsing MODE messages, it is recommended that the entire message
be parsed first and then the changes which resulted then passed on.</p>

<h4>4.2.3.1 Channel modes</h4>

</tbody></table>

<p>The MODE command is provided so that channel operators may change the
characteristics of `their' channel.  It is also required that servers
be able to change channel modes so that channel operators may be
created.</p>

<p>The various modes available for channels are as follows:</p>
  

  <dl compact="compact">
  <dt>o</dt><dd> - give/take channel operator privileges;</dd>
  <dt>p</dt><dd> - private channel flag;</dd>                 
  <dt>s</dt><dd> - secret channel flag;</dd>
  <dt>i</dt><dd> - invite-only channel flag;</dd>
  <dt>t</dt><dd> - topic settable by channel operator only flag;</dd>
  <dt>n</dt><dd> - no messages to channel from clients on the outside;</dd>
  <dt>m</dt><dd> - moderated channel;</dd>
  <dt>l</dt><dd> - set the user limit to channel;</dd>
  <dt>b</dt><dd> - set a ban mask to keep users out;</dd>
  <dt>v</dt><dd> - give/take the ability to speak on a moderated channel;</dd>
  <dt>k</dt><dd> - set a channel key (password).</dd>
  </dl>


<p>When using the 'o' and 'b' options, a restriction on a total of three
per mode command has been imposed.  </p>

<p>If only the channel parameter is specified, the server should
return the current mode of the channel, using RPL_CHANNELMODEIS.</p>

<h4>4.2.3.2 User modes</h4>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;nickname&gt; {[+|-]|i|w|s|o}</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The user MODEs are typically changes which affect either how the
client is seen by others or what 'extra' messages the client is sent.
A user MODE command may only be accepted if both the sender of the
message and the nickname given as a parameter are both the same.</p>

<p>The available modes are as follows:</p>

   <dl compact="compact">
   <dt>i</dt><dd> - marks a users as invisible;</dd>
   <dt>s</dt><dd> - marks a user for receipt of server notices;</dd>
   <dt>w</dt><dd> - user receives wallops;</dd>
   <dt>o</dt><dd> - operator flag</dd>
   </dl>

<p>Additional modes may be available later on.</p>

<p>If a user attempts to make themselves an operator using the "+o"
flag, the attempt should be ignored.  There is no restriction,
however, on anyone `deopping' themselves (using "-o").</p>

<p>If only the channel parameter is specified, the server should
return the current mode of the user, using RPL_UMODEIS.</p>

                         'invite-only'.

MODE #Finnish +o Kilroy  ; Gives 'chanop' privileges to Kilroy on

MODE #Fins -s            ; Removes 'secret' flag from channel
                         #Fins.

MODE #42 +k oulu         ; Set the channel key to "oulu".

MODE #eu-opers +l 10     ; Set the limit for the number of users
                         on channel to 10.

MODE &amp;oulu +b            ; list ban masks set for channel.

MODE &amp;oulu +b *!*@*      ; prevent all users from joining.

MODE &amp;oulu +b *!*@*.edu  ; prevent any user from a hostname
                         matching *.edu from joining.

Use of user Modes:

:MODE WiZ -w             ; turns reception of WALLOPS messages
                         off for WiZ.

:Angel MODE Angel +i     ; Message from Angel to make themselves
                         invisible.

MODE WiZ -o              ; WiZ 'deopping' (removing operator
                         status).  The plain reverse of this
                         command ("MODE WiZ +o") must not be
                         allowed from users since would bypass
                         the OPER command.

<p>By using the NAMES command, a user can list all nicknames that are
visible to them on any channel that they can see.  Channel names
which they can see are those which aren't private (+p) or secret (+s)
or those which they are actually on.  The &lt;channel&gt; parameter
specifies which channel(s) to return information about if valid.
There is no error reply for bad channel names.</p>

<p>If no &lt;channel&gt; parameter is given, a list of all channels and their
occupants is returned.  At the end of this list, a list of users who
are visible but either not on any channel or not on a visible channel
are listed as being on `channel' "*".</p>

<p>The response is returned using zero or more RPL_NAMREPLY
messages. The response is terminated with the RPL_ENDOFNAMES

the target channel &lt;channel&gt;.  There is no requirement that the
channel the target user is being invited to must exist or be a valid

<h2>4.3 Server queries and commands</h2>

<p>The server query group of commands has been designed to return
information about any server which is connected to the network.  All
servers connected must respond to these queries and respond
correctly.  Any invalid response (or lack thereof) must be considered
a sign of a broken server and it must be disconnected/disabled as
soon as possible until the situation is remedied.</p>

<p>In these queries, where a parameter appears as "&lt;server&gt;", it will
usually mean it can be a nickname or a server or a wildcard name of
some sort.  For each parameter, however, only one query and set of
replies is to be generated.</p>

<p>The VERSION message is used  to  query  the  version  of  the  server

</tbody></table>

<p>The stats message is used to query statistics of certain server.  If
&lt;server&gt; parameter is omitted, only the end of stats reply is sent
back.  The implementation of this command is highly dependent on the
server which replies, although the server must be able to supply
information as described by the queries below (or similar).</p>

<p>A query may be given by any single letter which is only checked by
the destination server (if given as the &lt;server&gt; parameter) and is
otherwise passed on by intermediate servers, ignored and unaltered.
The following queries are those found in the current IRC
implementation and provide a large portion of the setup information
for that server.  Although these may not be supported in the same way
by other versions, all servers should be able to supply a valid reply
to a STATS query which is consistent with the reply formats currently
used and the purpose of the query.</p>

<p>The currently supported queries are:</p>
   
   <dl compact="compact">
   <dt>c</dt><dd> - returns a list of servers which the server may connect to or allow connections from;</dd>
   <dt>h</dt><dd> - returns a list of servers which are either forced to be treated as leaves or allowed to act as hubs;</dd>
   <dt>i</dt><dd> - returns a list of hosts which the server allows a client to connect from;</dd>
   <dt>k</dt><dd> - returns a list of banned username/hostname combinations for that server;</dd>
   <dt>l</dt><dd> - returns a list of the server's connections, showing 
how long each connection has been established and the traffic over that 
connection in bytes and messages for each direction;</dd>
   <dt>m</dt><dd> - returns a list of commands supported by the server and the usage count for each if the usage count is non zero;</dd>
   <dt>o</dt><dd> - returns a list of hosts from which normal clients may become operators;</dd>
   <dt>y</dt><dd> - show Y (Class) lines from server's configuration file;</dd>

</tbody></table>

<p>TRACE command is used to find the route to specific server.  Each
server that processes this message must tell the sender about it by
sending a reply indicating it is a pass-through link, forming a chain
of replies similar to that gained from using "traceroute".  After
sending this reply back, it must then send the TRACE message to the
next server until given server is reached.  If the &lt;server&gt; parameter
is omitted, it is recommended that TRACE command send a message to
the sender telling which servers the current server has direct
connection to.</p>

<p>If the destination given by "&lt;server&gt;" is an actual server, then the
destination server is required to report all servers and users which
are connected to it, although only operators are permitted to see
users present.  If the destination given by &lt;server&gt; is a nickname,
they only a reply for that nickname is given.</p>

servers must return a RPL_TRACELINK reply to indicate that the TRACE
passed through it and where its going next.</p>

<h2>4.4 Sending messages</h2>

<p>The main purpose of the IRC protocol is to provide a base for clients
to communicate with each other.  PRIVMSG and NOTICE are the only
messages available which actually perform delivery of a text message
from one client to another - the rest just make it possible and try
to ensure it happens in a reliable and structured manner.</p>

<a name="c4_4_1"></a>
<h3>4.4.1 Private messages</h3>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>PRIVMSG</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;target&gt;{,&lt;target&gt;} &lt;text to be sent&gt;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>PRIVMSG is used to send private messages between users.  &lt;target&gt;
is the nickname of the receiver of the message.  &lt;target&gt; can also
be a list of names or channels separated with commas.</p>

<p>The &lt;target&gt; parameter may also me a host mask  (#mask)  or  server
mask  ($mask).   In  both cases the server will only send the PRIVMSG
to those who have a server or host matching the mask.  The mask  must
have at  least  1  (one)  "."  in it and no wildcards following the
last ".".  This requirement exists to prevent people sending messages
to  "#*"  or "$*",  which  would  broadcast  to  all  users; from
experience, this is abused more than used responsibly and properly.
Wildcards are  the  '*' and  '?'   characters.   This  extension  to
the PRIVMSG command is only available to Operators.</p>

<p>The message is delivered by sending a PRIVMSG with &lt;text to be
sent&gt; to each of the targets. ONe ERR_NOSUCHNICK reply is generated
for each &lt;target&gt; that does not match any nickname or channel.</p>

<p>In the case where the target is a channel, the message is delivered
to all users on the channel, except the originator of the message. The
&lt;target&gt; is set to the channel name.</p>

<h3>4.4.2 Notice</h3>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>NOTICE</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;nickname&gt; &lt;text&gt;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The NOTICE message is used similarly to PRIVMSG.  The difference
between NOTICE and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies must never be
sent in response to a NOTICE message.  This rule applies to servers
too - they must not send any error reply back to the client on
receipt of a notice.  The object of this rule is to avoid loops
between a client automatically sending something in response to
something it received.  This is typically used by automatons (clients
with either an AI or other interactive program controlling their
actions) which are always seen to be replying lest they end up in a
loop with another automaton.</p>

<a name="c4_5"></a>
<h2>4.5 User based queries</h2>

<p>User queries are a group of commands which are primarily concerned
with finding details on a particular user or group users.  When using
wildcards with any of these commands, if they match, they will only
return information on users who are 'visible' to you.  The visibility
of a user is determined as a combination of the user's mode and the
common set of channels you are both on.</p>

<a name="c4_5_1"></a>
<h3>4.5.1 Who query</h3>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>WHO</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>[&lt;name&gt;{,&lt;name&gt;} [&lt;o&gt;]]</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The WHO message is used by a client to generate a query which returns
a list of information which 'matches' the &lt;name&gt; parameter given by
the client.  In the absence of the &lt;name&gt; parameter, all visible
(users who aren't invisible (user mode +i) and who don't have a
common channel with the requesting client) are listed.  The same
result can be achieved by using a &lt;name&gt; of "0" or any wildcard which
will end up matching every entry possible.</p>

<p>The &lt;name&gt; passed to WHO is matched against users' host, server, real
name and nickname if the channel &lt;name&gt; cannot be found.</p>

<p>If the channel &lt;name&gt; is found, WHO returns information about
all the members of the channel.</p>

<p>If the "o" parameter is passed only operators are returned according
to the name mask supplied.</p>

<p>The reply is returned with zero or more RPL_WHOREPLY messages, and
terminated with a RPL_ENDOFWHO.</p>

        </tbody></table>

<p>Examples:</p>

<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>[&lt;server&gt;] &lt;nickmask&gt;[,&lt;nickmask&gt;[,...]]</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>This message is used to query information about particular user.  The
server will answer this message with several numeric messages
indicating different statuses of each user which matches the nickmask
(if you are entitled to see them).  If no wildcard is present in the
&lt;nickmask&gt;, any information about that nick which you are allowed to
see is presented.  A comma (',') separated list of nicknames may be
given.</p>

<p>The latter version sends the query to a specific server.  It is
useful if you want to know how long the user in question has been
idle as only local server (ie. the server the user is directly
connected to) knows that information, while everything else is
globally known.</p>

<p>A separate response (either ERR_NOSUCHNICK, or a set of RPL_WHOIS*
messages) is generated for each &lt;nickmask&gt;. The responses
are terminated with RPL_ENDOFWHOIS.</p>

<p>Whowas asks for information about a nickname which no longer exists.
This may either be due to a nickname change or the user leaving IRC.
In response to this query, the server searches through its nickname
history, looking for any nicks which are lexically the same (no wild
card matching here).  The history is searched backward, returning the
most recent entry first.  If there are multiple entries, up to
&lt;count&gt; replies will be returned (or all of them if no &lt;count&gt;
parameter is given).  If a non-positive number is passed as being
&lt;count&gt;, then a full search is done.</p>

<h3>4.6.1 Kill message</h3>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>KILL</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;nickname&gt; &lt;comment&gt;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The KILL message is used to cause a client-server connection to be
closed by the server which has the actual connection.  KILL is used
by servers when they encounter a duplicate entry in the list of valid
nicknames and is used to remove both entries.  It is also available
to operators.</p>

<p>Clients which have automatic reconnect algorithms effectively make
this command useless since the disconnection is only brief.  It does
however break the flow of data and can be used to stop large amounts
of being abused, any user may elect to receive KILL messages
generated for others to keep an 'eye' on would be trouble spots.</p>

<p>In an arena where nicknames are required to be globally unique at all
times, KILL messages are sent whenever 'duplicates' are detected
(that is an attempt to register two users with the same nickname) in
the hope that both of them will disappear and only 1 reappear.</p>

<p>The comment given must reflect the actual reason for the KILL.  For
server-generated KILLs it usually is made up of details concerning
the origins of the two conflicting nicknames.  For users it is left
up to them to provide an adequate reason to satisfy others who see
it.  To prevent/discourage fake KILLs from being generated to hide
the identify of the KILLer, the comment also shows a 'kill-path'
which is updated by each server it passes through, each prepending
its name to the path.</p>

<p>The PING message is used to test the presence of an active client at
the other end of the connection.  A PING message is sent at regular
intervals if no other activity detected coming from a connection.  If
a connection fails to respond to a PING command within a set amount
of time, that connection is closed.</p>

<p>Any client which receives a PING message must respond to &lt;server1&gt;
(server which sent the PING message out) as quickly as possible with
an appropriate PONG message to indicate it is still there and alive.
Servers should not respond to PING commands but rely on PINGs from
the other end of the connection to indicate the connection is alive.
If the &lt;server2&gt; parameter is specified, the PING message gets
forwarded there.</p>

<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">   Command: </th><td>ERROR</td></tr>
<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;error message&gt;</td></tr>

<p>The ERROR command is for use by servers when reporting a serious or
fatal error to its operators.  It may also be sent from one server to
another but must not be accepted from any normal unknown clients.</p>

<p>An ERROR message is for use for reporting errors which occur with a
server-to-server link only.  An ERROR message is sent to the server
at the other end (which sends it to all of its connected operators)
and to all operators currently connected.  It is not to be passed
onto any other servers by a server if it is received from a server.</p>

<p>When a server sends a received ERROR message to its operators, the
message should be encapsulated inside a NOTICE message, indicating
that the client was not responsible for the error.</p>

<p>Numerics:</p>

        <center>None.</center>

<p>The restart message can only be used by an operator to force a server
restart itself.  This message is optional since it may be viewed as a
risk to allow arbitrary people to connect to a server as an operator
and execute this command, causing (at least) a disruption to service.</p>

<p>The RESTART command must always be fully processed by the server to
which the sending client is connected and not be passed onto other
connected servers.</p>

<p>The SUMMON command can be used to give users who are on a host
running an IRC server a message asking them to please join IRC.  This
message is only sent if the target server (a) has SUMMON enabled, (b)
the user is logged in and (c) the server process can write to the
user's tty (or similar).</p>

<p>If no &lt;server&gt; parameter is given it tries to summon &lt;user&gt; from the
server the client is connected to is assumed as the target.</p>

<p>If summon is not enabled in a server, it must return the
ERR_SUMMONDISABLED numeric and pass the summon message onwards.</p>

<p>Sends  a  message  to  all   operators   currently   online.    After
implementing  WALLOPS  as  a user command it was found that it was
often and commonly abused as a means of sending a message to a lot
of  people (much  similar to WALL).  Due to this it is recommended
that the current implementation of  WALLOPS  be  used  as  an
example  by  allowing  and recognising only servers as the senders of
WALLOPS.</p>

<tr><th align="LEFT">Parameters: </th><td>&lt;nickname&gt;{&lt;space&gt;&lt;nickname&gt;}</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The ISON command was implemented to provide  a  quick  and  efficient
means  to get a response about whether a given nickname was currently
on IRC. ISON only takes one (1) parameter: a space-separated list of
nicks.  For  each  nickname in the list that is present, the server
adds that to its reply string.  Thus the reply string may return
empty (none  of  the given  nicks are present), an exact copy of the
parameter string (all of them present) or as any other subset of the
set of nicks  given  in  the parameter.  The only limit on the number
of nicks that may be checked is that the combined length must not be
too large as to cause the server to chop it off so it fits in 512
characters.</p>

<p>ISON is only be processed by the server local to the client sending
the command and thus not passed onto other servers for further
processing.</p>

                  messages are to enumerate all the channels of which

                - The RPL_TRACE* are all returned by the server in

<h1>7. Client and server authentication</h1>

   <p>Clients and servers are both subject to the same level of
   authentication.  For both, an IP number to hostname lookup (and
   reverse check on this) is performed for all connections made to the
   server.  Both connections are then subject to a password check (if
   there is a password set for that connection).  These checks are
   possible on all connections although the password check is only
   commonly used with servers.</p>

   <p>An additional check that is becoming of more and more common is that
   of the username responsible for making the connection.  Finding the
   username of the other end of the connection typically involves
   connecting to an authentication server such as IDENT as described in
   RFC 1413.</p>

   <p>Given that without passwords it is not easy to reliably determine who
   is on the other end of a network connection, use of passwords is
   strongly recommended on inter-server connections in addition to any
   other measures such as using an ident server.</p>

<h1>8. Current implementations</h1>

   <p>The only current implementation of this protocol is the IRC server,
   version 2.8. Earlier versions may implement some or all of the
   commands described by this document with NOTICE messages replacing
   many of the numeric replies.  Unfortunately, due to backward
   compatibility requirements, the implementation of some parts of this
   document varies with what is laid out.  On notable difference is:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>recognition that any LF or CR anywhere in a message marks the
          end of that message (instead of requiring CR-LF);</li>
        </ul>

   <p>The rest of this section deals with issues that are mostly of
   importance to those who wish to implement a server but some parts
   also apply directly to clients as well.</p>

<a name="c8_1"></a>
<h2>8.1 Network protocol: TCP - why it is best used here.</h2>

   <p>IRC has been implemented on top of TCP since TCP supplies a reliable
   network protocol which is well suited to this scale of conferencing.
   The use of multicast IP is an alternative, but it is not widely
   available or supported at the present time.</p>

<a name="c8_1_1"></a>
<h3>8.1.1 Support of Unix sockets</h3>

   <p>Given that Unix domain sockets allow listen/connect operations, the
   current implementation can be configured to listen and accept both
   client and server connections on a Unix domain socket.  These are
   recognized as sockets where the hostname starts with a '/'.</p>

   <p>When providing any information about the connections on a Unix domain
   socket, the server is required to supplant the actual hostname in
   place of the pathname unless the actual socket name is being asked
   for.</p>

<a name="c8_2"></a>
<h2>8.2 Command Parsing</h2>

   <p>To provide useful 'non-buffered' network IO for clients and servers,
   each connection is given its own private 'input buffer' in which the
   results of the most recent read and parsing are kept.  A buffer size
   of 512 bytes is used so as to hold 1 full message, although, this
   will usually hold several commands.  The private buffer is parsed
   after every read operation for valid messages.  When dealing with
   multiple messages from one client in the buffer, care should be taken
   in case one happens to cause the client to be 'removed'.</p>

<a name="c8_3"></a>
<h2>8.3 Message delivery</h2>

   <p>It is common to find network links saturated or hosts to which you
   are sending data unable to send data.  Although Unix typically
   handles this through the TCP window and internal buffers, the server
   often has large amounts of data to send (especially when a new
   server-server link forms) and the small buffers provided in the
   kernel are not enough for the outgoing queue.  To alleviate this
   problem, a "send queue" is used as a FIFO queue for data to be sent.
   A typical "send queue" may grow to 200 Kbytes on a large IRC network
   with a slow network connection when a new server connects.</p>

   <p>When polling its connections, a server will first read and parse all
   incoming data, queuing any data to be sent out. When all available
   input is processed, the queued data is sent. This reduces the number
   of write() system calls and helps TCP make bigger packets.</p>

<a name="c8_4"></a>
<h2>8.4 Connection 'Liveness'</h2>

   <p>To detect when a connection has died or become unresponsive, the
   server must ping each of its connections that it doesn't get a
   response from in a given amount of time.</p>

   <p>If a connection doesn't respond in time, its connection is closed
   using the appropriate procedures.  A connection is also dropped if
   its sendq grows beyond the maximum allowed, because it is better to
   close a slow connection than have a server process block.</p>

<a name="c8_5"></a>
<h2>8.5 Establishing a server to client connection</h2>

   <p>Upon connecting to an IRC server, a client is sent the MOTD (if
   present) as well as the current user/server count (as per the LUSER
   command).  The server is also required to give an unambiguous message
   to the client which states its name and version as well as any other
   introductory messages which may be deemed appropriate.</p>

   <p>After dealing with this, the server must then send out the new user's
   nickname and other information as supplied by itself (USER command)
   and as the server could discover (from DNS/authentication servers).
   The server must send this information out with NICK first followed by
   USER.</p>

<a name="c8_6"></a>
<h2>8.6 Establishing a server-server connection.</h2>

   <p>The process of establishing of a server-to-server connection is
   fraught with danger since there are many possible areas where
   problems can occur - the least of which are race conditions.</p>

   <p>After a server has received a connection following by a PASS/SERVER
   pair which were recognised as being valid, the server should then
   reply with its own PASS/SERVER information for that connection as
   well as all of the other state information it knows about as
   described below.</p>

   <p>When the initiating server receives a PASS/SERVER pair, it too then
   checks that the server responding is authenticated properly before
   accepting the connection to be that server.</p>

<a name="c8_6_1"></a>
<h3>8.6.1 Server exchange of state information when connecting</h3>

   <p>The order of state information being exchanged between servers is
   essential.  The required order is as follows:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>all known other servers;</li>

        <li>all known user information;</li>

        <li>all known channel information.</li>
        </ul>

   <p>Information regarding servers is sent via extra SERVER messages, user
   information with NICK/USER/MODE/JOIN messages and channels with MODE
   messages.</p>

   <p>NOTE: channel topics are *NOT* exchanged here because the TOPIC
   command overwrites any old topic information, so at best, the two
   sides of the connection would exchange topics.</p>

   <p>By passing the state information about servers first, any collisions
   with servers that already exist occur before nickname collisions due
   to a second server introducing a particular nickname.  Due to the IRC
   network only being able to exist as an acyclic graph, it may be
   possible that the network has already reconnected in another
   location, the place where the collision occurs indicating where the
   net needs to split.</p>

<a name="c8_7"></a>
<h2>8.7 Terminating server-client connections</h2>

   <p>When a client connection closes, a QUIT message is generated on
   behalf of the client by the server to which the client connected.  No
   other message is to be generated or used.</p>

<a name="c8_8"></a>
<h2>8.8 Terminating server-server connections</h2>

   <p>If a server-server connection is closed, either via a remotely
   generated SQUIT or 'natural' causes, the rest of the connected IRC
   network must have its information updated with by the server which
   detected the closure.  The server then sends a list of SQUITs (one
   for each server behind that connection) and a list of QUITs (again,
   one for each client behind that connection).</p>

<a name="c8_9"></a>
<h2>8.9 Tracking nickname changes</h2>

   <p>All IRC servers are required to keep a history of recent nickname
   changes.  This is required to allow the server to have a chance of
   keeping in touch of things when nick-change race conditions occur
   with commands which manipulate them.  Commands which must trace nick
   changes are:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>KILL (the nick being killed)</li>

        <li>MODE (+/- o,v)</li>

        <li>KICK (the nick being kicked)</li>
        </ul>

   <p>No other commands are to have nick changes checked for.</p>

   <p>In the above cases, the server is required to first check for the
   existence of the nickname, then check its history to see who that
   nick currently belongs to (if anyone!).  This reduces the chances of
   race conditions but they can still occur with the server ending up
   affecting the wrong client.  When performing a change trace for an
   above command it is recommended that a time range be given and
   entries which are too old ignored.</p>

   <p>For a reasonable history, a server should be able to keep previous
   nickname for every client it knows about if they all decided to
   change.  This size is limited by other factors (such as memory, etc).</p>

<h2>8.10 Flood control of clients</h2>

   <p>With a large network of interconnected IRC servers, it is quite easy
   for any single client attached to the network to supply a continuous
   stream of messages that result in not only flooding the network, but
   also degrading the level of service provided to others.  Rather than
   require every 'victim' to be provide their own protection, flood
   protection was written into the server and is applied to all clients
   except services.  The current algorithm is as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>check to see if client's `message timer' is less than
          current time (set to be equal if it is);</li>

        <li>read any data present from the client;</li>

        <li>while the timer is less than ten seconds ahead of the current
          time, parse any present messages and penalize the client by
          2 seconds for each message;</li>
        </ul>

   <p>which in essence means that the client may send 1 message every 2
   seconds without being adversely affected.</p>

<a name="c8_11"></a>
<h2>8.11 Non-blocking lookups</h2>

   <p>In a real-time environment, it is essential that a server process do
   as little waiting as possible so that all the clients are serviced
   fairly.  Obviously this requires non-blocking IO on all network
   read/write operations.  For normal server connections, this was not
   difficult, but there are other support operations that may cause the
   server to block (such as disk reads).  Where possible, such activity
   should be performed with a short timeout.</p>

<a name="c8_11_1"></a>
<h3>8.11.1 Hostname (DNS) lookups</h3>

   <p>Using the standard resolver libraries from Berkeley and others has
   meant large delays in some cases where replies have timed out.  To
   avoid this, a separate set of DNS routines were written which were
   setup for non-blocking IO operations and then polled from within the
   main server IO loop.</p>

<a name="c8_11_2"></a>
<h3>8.11.2 Username (Ident) lookups</h3>

   <p>Although there are numerous ident libraries for use and inclusion
   into other programs, these caused problems since they operated in a
   synchronous manner and resulted in frequent delays.  Again the
   solution was to write a set of routines which would cooperate with
   the rest of the server and work using non-blocking IO.</p>

<a name="c8_12"></a>
<h2>8.12 Configuration File</h2>

   <p>To provide a flexible way of setting up and running the server, it is
   recommended that a configuration file be used which contains
   instructions to the server on the following:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>which hosts to accept client connections from;</li>

        <li>which hosts to allow to connect as servers;</li>

        <li>which hosts to connect to (both actively and
          passively);</li>

        <li>information about where the server is (university,
          city/state, company are examples of this);</li>

        <li>who is responsible for the server and an email address
          at which they can be contacted;</li>

        <li>hostnames and passwords for clients which wish to be given
          access to restricted operator commands.</li>
        </ul>

   <p>In specifying hostnames, both domain names and use of the 'dot'
   notation (127.0.0.1) should both be accepted.  It must be possible to
   specify the password to be used/accepted for all outgoing and
   incoming connections (although the only outgoing connections are
   those to other servers).</p>

   <p>The above list is the minimum requirement for any server which wishes
   to make a connection with another server.  Other items which may be
   of use are:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>specifying which servers other server may introduce;</li>

        <li>how deep a server branch is allowed to become;</li>

        <li>hours during which clients may connect.</li>
        </ul>

<a name="c8_12_1"></a>
<h3>8.12.1 Allowing clients to connect</h3>

   <p>A server should use some sort of 'access control list' (either in the
   configuration file or elsewhere) that is read at startup and used to
   decide what hosts clients may use to connect to it.</p>

   <p>Both 'deny' and 'allow' should be implemented to provide the required
   flexibility for host access control.</p>

<a name="c8_12_2"></a>
<h3>8.12.2 Operators</h3>

   <p>The granting of operator privileges to a disruptive person can have
   dire consequences for the well-being of the IRC net in general due to
   the powers given to them.  Thus, the acquisition of such powers
   should not be very easy.  The current setup requires two 'passwords'
   to be used although one of them is usually easy guessed.  Storage of
   oper passwords in configuration files is preferable to hard coding
   them in and should be stored in a crypted format (ie using crypt(3)
   from Unix) to prevent easy theft.</p>

<a name="c8_12_3"></a>
<h3>8.12.3 Allowing servers to connect</h3>

   <p>The interconnection of server is not a trivial matter: a bad
   connection can have a large impact on the usefulness of IRC.  Thus,
   each server should have a list of servers to which it may connect and
   which servers may connect to it.  Under no circumstances should a
   server allow an arbitrary host to connect as a server.  In addition
   to which servers may and may not connect, the configuration file
   should also store the password and other characteristics of that
   link.</p>

<a name="c8_12_4"></a>
<h3>8.12.4 Administrivia</h3>

   <p>To provide accurate and valid replies to the ADMIN command (see
   section <a href="#c4_3_7">4.3.7</a>), the server should find the relevant details in the
   configuration.</p>

<a name="c8_13"></a>
<h2>8.13 Channel membership</h2>

   <p>The current server allows any registered local user to join upto 10
   different channels.  There is no limit imposed on non-local users so
   that the server remains (reasonably) consistant with all others on a
   channel membership basis</p>

<h1>9. Current problems</h1>

   <p>There are a number of recognized problems with this protocol, all  of
   which  hope to be solved sometime in the near future during its
   rewrite.  Currently, work is underway to find working solutions to
   these problems.</p>

<a name="c9_1"></a>
<h2>9.1 Scalability</h2>

   <p>It is widely recognized that this protocol does not scale
   sufficiently well when used in a large arena.  The main problem comes
   from the requirement that all servers know about all other servers
   and users and that information regarding them be updated as soon as
   it changes.  It is also desirable to keep the number of servers low
   so that the path length between any two points is kept minimal and
   the spanning tree as strongly branched as possible.</p>

<a name="c9_2"></a>
<h2>9.2 Labels</h2>

   <p>The current IRC protocol has 3 types of labels: the nickname, the
   channel name and the server name.  Each of the three types has its
   own domain and no duplicates are allowed inside that domain.
   Currently, it is possible for users to pick the label for any of the
   three, resulting in collisions.  It is widely recognized that this
   needs reworking, with a plan for unique names for channels and nicks
   that don't collide being desirable as well as a solution allowing a
   cyclic tree.</p>

<a name="c9_2_1"></a>
<h3>9.2.1 Nicknames</h3>

   <p>The idea of the nickname on IRC is very convenient for users to use
   when talking to each other outside of a channel, but there is only a
   finite nickname space and being what they are, its not uncommon for
   several people to want to use the same nick.  If a nickname is chosen
   by two people using this protocol, either one will not succeed or
   both will removed by use of KILL (<a href="#c4_6_1">4.6.1</a>).</p>

<a name="c9_2_2"></a>
<h3>9.2.2 Channels</h3>

   <p>The current channel layout requires that all servers know about all
   channels, their inhabitants and properties.  Besides not scaling
   well, the issue of privacy is also a concern.  A collision of
   channels is treated as an inclusive event (both people who create the
   new channel are considered to be members of it) rather than an
   exclusive one such as used to solve nickname collisions.</p>

<a name="c9_2_3"></a>
<h3>9.2.3 Servers</h3>

   <p>Although the number of servers is usually small relative to the
   number of users and channels, they two currently required to be known
   globally, either each one separately or hidden behind a mask.</p>

<a name="c9_3"></a>
<h3>9.3 Algorithms</h3>

   <p>In some places within the server code, it has not  been  possible  to
   avoid  N^2  algorithms  such  as  checking  the channel list of a set
   of clients.</p>

   <p>In current server versions, there are no database consistency checks,
   each server assumes that a neighbouring server is correct.  This
   opens the door to large problems if a connecting server is buggy or
   otherwise tries to introduce contradictions to the existing net.</p>

   <p>Currently, because of the lack of unique internal and global labels,
   there are a multitude of race conditions that exist.  These race
   conditions generally arise from the problem of it taking time for
   messages to traverse and effect the IRC network.  Even by changing to
   unique labels, there are problems with channel-related commands being
   disrupted.</p>
